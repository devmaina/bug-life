### DevOps Bug Blog

A single-page application (SPA) serving as the front-end for a technical blog specializing in DevOps, DevSecOps, and cybersecurity. The project is engineered for optimal performance, user experience, and scalability, utilizing a minimalist tech stack to ensure high efficiency and easy deployment.

### Project Overview

This project is a front-end build demonstrating modern web development best practices without the complexity of a full-stack framework. It features dynamic content loading, a seamless in-page article reading experience, and a modular CSS structure. The entire application is self-contained in a single `index.html` file, making it ideal for rapid prototyping, static hosting, or as a foundational template for a more complex architecture.

### Key Technical Features

* **Responsive Architecture:** The codebase is built with a mobile-first approach, employing CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts to ensure a fluid, adaptive design across all viewport sizes.
* **Performance Optimization:**
    * **CDN-based Assets:** External dependencies like Google Fonts and Font Awesome are loaded via Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to leverage browser caching and reduce latency.
    * **Vanilla JS:** The use of vanilla JavaScript, free from framework overhead, ensures a minimal footprint and fast execution times.
    * **CSS Animations:** On-scroll reveal effects are implemented purely with CSS, offloading animation logic from the main JavaScript thread for smoother rendering.
* **Component-Driven UI:** Although not a true framework, the CSS is structured into logical components (e.g., `header`, `sidebar`, `article-card`, `article-modal`), promoting code reusability and maintainability.
* **Interactive Modals:** The article viewing feature uses a CSS-driven modal overlay. The JavaScript handles the display state, but the visual transitions and `sticky` close button are managed by CSS, demonstrating a separation of concerns between logic and presentation.
* **SEO & Accessibility:** The use of semantic HTML5 tags and descriptive class names improves search engine crawlability and accessibility. The on-page content is also accessible via the search function and sidebar navigation.
